# python-challenge

The Python Challenge consists of creating two scripts written in Python; PyBank and PyPoll. 

PyBank analyzed financial records of a company. The results are a Financial Analysis using Dates and Profit/Losses source data for 86 months. In this time, the company had a profit of $38,3825,578. The average change per month was $-2,315. We can conclude the greatest monthly increase in profits occurred in February 2012 and the greatest decrease was in Sept 2013.

PyPoll analyzed election data from a small town to modernize its vote counting process. The Election data contained the voter ID, the county the voter was from, and the candidate that was voted for to determine the winner. The election results show total votes of 3,521,001. Each of the four candidate's number of votes and percentage are displayed on the report and show who the winner of the election is.
